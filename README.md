# Website Template
A fully functional website template that I made for a small business owner selling women garments.

HTML5 ,CSS3 , PHP, MySql and little bit of javascript is used and is built from scratch.

Adobe Dreamweaver 2015 is used to build the project.

All the folders are in order and all the data is already in there.

To view the template simply open the "index.html" file.

p.s.- this site is currently not live. Will update once it goes online.
